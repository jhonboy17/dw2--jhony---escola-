# Project Report

## Overview
This project is designed to create a web application with a frontend and backend structure. The frontend is responsible for the user interface, while the backend handles data processing and server-side logic.

## Progress
- The project structure has been established with the necessary files and folders.
- The frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) have been created to facilitate the user interface.
- The backend files (Python scripts) have been set up to manage server operations and database interactions.

## Issues
- Currently, there are no known issues. Further testing will be conducted as development progresses.

## Next Steps
- Implement the functionality in the frontend files to create a dynamic user experience.
- Develop the backend logic to handle API requests and database operations.
- Test the integration between the frontend and backend components.

## Outcomes
- A functional web application that meets the project requirements will be the final goal.
- Documentation will be updated regularly to reflect changes and progress in the project.
